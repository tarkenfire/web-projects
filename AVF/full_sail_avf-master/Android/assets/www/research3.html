					<h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</h3>
					<p>This varies on what you define as “selling”, being grossing, install base for free ad-supported apps, or simple sales. For sake of not getting into the dynamics of paid-app vs ad-based free apps in which can make more, I will assume this simply is only referring to paid apps.</p>
					<p>For iOS, getting statistics is easy, since Apple discloses them for all regions, to all regions, and stat aggregation sites. Android is harder in that Google only gives the statistics for the region you are in, and you need to physically find someone in the region (or a site) to get the info.</p>
					<p>Firstly, for Android, in the US, the top paid apps, consisting of 15 in the aggregation I used, contain 4 games, 3 “component replacement” apps (a category unique to Android), 2 aesthetic UI apps, 2 utility apps, 2 misc apps, and 2 media apps.</p>
					<p>A similar trend is followed in the European market.</p>
					<p>In Japan, the top paid apps from a different, regional aggregation source that does top 10 lists, broke down as follows: 2 “augmented picture taking” apps, 1 IM app, 2 utility apps, 3 games, and 2 “erotic” games.</p>
					<p>Apple breaks things down in terms of iPhone and iPad sales, and the aggregation site I used once again uses list of 15. Here’s the breakdown.</p>
					<h5>US:</h5>
					<p>For the iPhone, 12 of the top apps are games, with the remaining three consisting of a picture-taking app, a utility app, and an IM app. For the iPad, all 15 top apps are games.</p>
					<h5>England:</h5>
					<p>iPhone, 10 games, many of the same from the US charts. The remaining five include the three non game apps mentioned above, as well as a third-party YouTube client and an alarm clock. iPad, 14 games and 1 weather app.</p>
					<h5>Japan:</h5>
					<p>iPhone, around 7 games and 8 utility/ aesthetic apps. iPad, there is 1 game on the top list, with the remaining 14 almost entirely utility apps.</p>
					<p>It’s worth noting here that that in the “Free” app categories of both these platforms, social networking apps and games are completely dominant, which is indicative of how people are more willing to pay for productivity/utility apps than games, which I will expand upon in the section where I give recommendations…which is right now.</p>
					<h3>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h3>
					<p>The US and EU markets trend towards the same goal, so I’ll address them together. iOS is completely dominated by games, whereas Android has a more rounded distribution between games and work-ish apps.  Only Apple discloses tablet vs smartphone stats, so let’s touch on that topic.  In these two markets, both phones and tablets, in the consumer market, seem top be focused more as “entertainment devices” than “work tools”.</p>
					<p>In Japan, this is a segue by the way, this trend is not the same, with (iOS) smartphones having a relatively even split between utilities and games.</p>
					<p>The Android statistics trend towards the iPhone like split of utility vs games, but since there is no readily available tablet vs smartphone statistics, the breakdown of what the Japanese use smartphones for and tablets for can only be inferred to be similar to the iOS split. </p>

					<h3>What are the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h3>
					<p>The US and UK are fairly similar in average upload/download speeds, 4mbps/15.5mbps and 3.5mbps/19.29mbps.</p>
					<p>Japan’s upload/download ratio is 36.82mbps/15.92mbps, likely due to a combo of a fairly small size (Japan is about the size of California with a population (as of 2012) of 127 million, a little bit over 1/3rd of the entire US population), a large economy (…despite being in the midst of a 20+ year recession), and a rather large focus on technological infrastructure and advancement.</p>
					<p>In terms of cost, the average American pays 36 US Dollars per month for internet, the average Englishman comes close at around 33 US Dollars, and the average Japanese person blows both of them out of the water at around 49 US dollars per month.</p>
					<h3>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h3>
					<p>Well, the demographics show that if you’re really gunning for a mobile game, then your focus should be heavier in the US and UK (and likely rest of the EU as well) more than Japan. Furthermore, you should be focused more on iOS than Android for said game.</p>
					<p>If you’re aiming for a utility application, then the Japanese market is your best bet for iOS, whereas Android has a split in most of the markets where you would be able to exploit. </p>
					<p>Japan doesn’t like tablets as non-tool devices (yet), if the trends about iOS for tablets are to be believed.</p>
					<p>So, the overarching theme is that the iOS market is dominated by games in the US and UK, and split in Japan. Android tends to be split regardless of what market it is in. </p>
					<p>This means that, assuming correct design and marketing, any type of app could be marketable in Japan on any platform. Conversely, games are more prevalent in the other two markets. This can mean that games are either the best or worst option; more people means more chances to make money, but also means more competition for your app, whereas there could </p>
					<p>Another factor that could be considered is the proliferation of culture throughout the world. English is a persuasive language in the European Union, in part thanks to the economic interchange stemming from the bloc itself. That’s a lot of people outside of England who can understand English well enough to market there without direct language translations/localizations. </p>
					<p>Since the 1970s, Japanese schoolchildren have been required to study at least 6 years of written English, and as a result, there is currently 1-2 generations with a good grasp on written English. Similar things can be said in Korea and China, meaning those are two additional markets (China is a somewhat impossible market for reasons that would take more than a sentence to explain, but I’ll cite them for the sake of this hypothetical).</p>
					<p>Generally speaking, Canadians speak English as well, and culturally speaking, would likely be receptive of the American version of the app. Mexico isn’t as promising of a market without any localization however.</p>
					<p>So, I suppose that’s my overarching theme with my advice on how to market for these three markets: Don’t market for three markets, market for the world. You can start in three countries, but you most certainly cannot stay in those three countries with the potential for profit at minimal cost in regions similar to those markets. (this is excluding extremely niche apps, of course.)</p>
					<p>To sum this up in line with the question asked, the topic of the app can truly be anything, as in the overarching market there are advantages to and reasons for developing any kind of given app. With regards to which of the regions that the app should be aimed at, my answer boils down to “the world”. In an age of globalization, the concept of limiting oneself to three markets is laughable. Resource constraints can mean that one must start in three markets, but this should only be a starting point for a more global strategy, using the advancements in those seeding territories as building blocks for further progress.</p>
